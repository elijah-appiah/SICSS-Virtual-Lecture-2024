The objective of the lesson was to guide participants on how to handle big data in R using **`data.table`** package, as well as connect to **Apache Spark** through the **`sparklyr`** package. The lesson also demonstrated how to analyze big data using **_machine learning algorithms_** such as **logistic regression**, **decision tree**, and **random forest**.
